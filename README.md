# Cat Repo

An amazing & easy-to-do way to display all your cats **(or basically whatever you want)**

### Installation

Cat Repo has been designed for easy installation in mind. Before we get started, you need to install and run Mock REST API (https://github.com/rrgarciach/mocky-rest-api/) on your computer. Next, just clone this repository to your desired location and run the installation command on your terminal:

```
npm run install
```

When installation is finished, start the project by running:

```
npm run serve
```

**Now you're ready to login!**

### Authentication

You need to use one of the following credentials depending on what role you want to take.

`Admin credentials`

    "password": "asdf123!"
```

`User credentials`

```
